Like the original, players collect cards featuring various types of train cars (and now ships) which are then used to claim routes around the world. The longer the routes, the more points you earn. Additional points can be earned by fulfilling Destination Tickets or goal cards that connect distant cities. The player who builds the longest continuous route wins the game. This version includes a double-sided game board. One side shows the Great Lakes of North America and the other shows the world.',
